# SolveMazeRecursively
Uses recursion to solve a maze and find way out.

A problem set of 5, all are solved using recursion. Sort of serves as recursion practice for me.

Problem 1. minRec1: finds smallest element in a set using decomposition of n-1
Problem 2. minRec2: finds smallest element in a set using decomposition n/2
Problem 3. squareRec: calculates the square root of a number
Problem 4. recursive strcmp function that compares only the letters in the strings and ignores the case.
Problem 5. Recursive maze solver
